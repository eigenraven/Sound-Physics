# Sound-Physics
A Minecraft mod that provides realistic sound attenuation, reverberation, and absorption through blocks.

This is a fork of a fork of a fork! I forked it djpadbit,who forked it from daipenger who forked it from sonicether, daipenger ported it to 1.12.2 and updated the mod, djpadbit just added some stuff.

This fork moves most of the 1.7.10 asm into mixins, making it much easier to tell what's going on. I am not planning on maintaining this fork but feel free to use it.

Djpadbit fork info:
* Dynamic environment evaluation (disabled by default, enable in mod config ingame)
* Automatic stereo to mono down-mixing of sounds
* More compatibility with mods (for now only computronics)

And that's pretty much it. yeah, that's not a lot.
